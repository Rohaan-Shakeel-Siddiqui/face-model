# Getting Started

The face-model is a frontend for the [face-model-api](https://github.com/harshcut/face-model-api), built with React, state management with Redux and TailwindCSS. Get response from Clarifai API and see it visualize. More on Clarifai's `face-detection` model can be found [here](https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection).
